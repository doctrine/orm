The installation of doctrine is very easy. Just get the latest revision of Doctrine from http://doctrine.pengus.net/svn/trunk. 

You need a SVN(Subversion) client for downloading Doctrine.

In order to check out Doctrine in the current directory using the **svn** command line tool use the following code: 
<code type="bash">
svn co http://doctrine.pengus.net/svn/trunk . 
</code>

If you do not have a SVN client, chose one from the list below. Find the **Checkout** option and enter http://doctrine.pengus.net/svn/trunk in the **path** or **repository url** parameter. There is no need for a username or password to check out Doctrine.
