Custom Mapping Types
====================

Doctrine allows you to create new mapping types. This can come in
handy when you're missing a specific mapping type or when you want
to replace the existing implementation of a mapping type.

In order to create a new mapping type you need to subclass
``Doctrine\DBAL\Types\Type`` and implement/override the methods as
you wish. Here is an example skeleton of such a custom type class:

.. code-block:: php

    <?php
    namespace My\Project\Types;

    use Doctrine\DBAL\Types\Type;
    use Doctrine\DBAL\Platforms\AbstractPlatform;

    /**
     * My custom datatype.
     */
    class MyType extends Type
    {
        const MYTYPE = 'mytype'; // modify to match your type name

        public function getSQLDeclaration(array $fieldDeclaration, AbstractPlatform $platform)
        {
            // return the SQL used to create your column type. To create a portable column type, use the $platform.
        }

        public function convertToPHPValue($value, AbstractPlatform $platform)
        {
            // This is executed when the value is read from the database. Make your conversions here, optionally using the $platform.
        }

        public function convertToDatabaseValue($value, AbstractPlatform $platform)
        {
            // This is executed when the value is written to the database. Make your conversions here, optionally using the $platform.
        }

        public function getName()
        {
            return self::MYTYPE; // modify to match your constant name
        }
    }

.. note::

    The following assumptions are applied to mapping types by the ORM:

    -  The ``UnitOfWork`` never passes values to the database convert
       method that did not change in the request.
    -  The ``UnitOfWork`` internally assumes that entity identifiers are
       castable to string. Hence, when using custom types that map to PHP
       objects as IDs, such objects must implement the ``__toString()`` magic
       method.

When you have implemented the type you still need to let Doctrine
know about it. This can be achieved through the
``Doctrine\DBAL\Types\Type#addType($name, $className)``
method. See the following example:

.. code-block:: php

    <?php
    // in bootstrapping code

    // ...

    use Doctrine\DBAL\Types\Type;

    // ...

    // Register my type
    Type::addType('mytype', 'My\Project\Types\MyType');

To convert the underlying database type of your
new "mytype" directly into an instance of ``MyType`` when performing
schema operations, the type has to be registered with the database
platform as well:

.. code-block:: php

    <?php
    $conn = $em->getConnection();
    $conn->getDatabasePlatform()->registerDoctrineTypeMapping('db_mytype', 'mytype');

When registering the custom types in the configuration you specify a unique
name for the mapping type and map that to the corresponding fully qualified
class name. Now the new type can be used when mapping columns:

.. code-block:: php

    <?php
    class MyPersistentClass
    {
        /** @Column(type="mytype") */
        private $field;
    }


When you have implemented the mapping type that shares SQL declaration
with another one, it will be ambiguous while mapping. ORM will use first
registered type, probably built-in, what could make type mistakes and
redundant auto-generated migrations. To make new types unambiguous,
require SQL Comment Hints.

.. code-block:: php

    <?php
    namespace My\Project\Types;

    use Doctrine\DBAL\Types\Type;
    use Doctrine\DBAL\Platforms\AbstractPlatform;

    /**
     * My custom datatype.
     */
    class MyType extends Type
    {
        // ...

        public function requiresSQLCommentHint(AbstractPlatform $platform)
        {
            return true;
        }
    }
