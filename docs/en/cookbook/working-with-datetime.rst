Working with DateTime Instances
===============================

There are many nitty gritty details when working with PHPs DateTime instances. You have to know their inner
workings pretty well not to make mistakes with date handling. This cookbook entry holds several
interesting pieces of information on how to work with PHP DateTime instances in ORM.

DateTime changes are detected by Reference
~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~

When calling ``EntityManager#flush()`` Doctrine computes the changesets of all the currently managed entities
and saves the differences to the database. In case of object properties (@Column(type="datetime") or @Column(type="object"))
these comparisons are always made **BY REFERENCE**. That means the following change will **NOT** be saved into the database:

.. code-block:: php

    <?php
    /** @Entity */
    class Article
    {
        /** @Column(type="datetime") */
        private $updated;

        public function setUpdated()
        {
            // will NOT be saved in the database
            $this->updated->modify("now");
        }
    }

The way to go would be:

.. code-block:: php

    <?php
    class Article
    {
        public function setUpdated()
        {
            // WILL be saved in the database
            $this->updated = new \DateTime("now");
        }
    }

Default Timezone Gotcha
~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~

By default Doctrine assumes that you are working with a default timezone. Each DateTime instance that
is created by Doctrine will be assigned the timezone that is currently the default, either through
the ``date.timezone`` ini setting or by calling ``date_default_timezone_set()``.

This is very important to handle correctly if your application runs on different servers or is moved from one to another server
(with different timezone settings). You have to make sure that the timezone is the correct one
on all this systems.

Handling different Timezones with the DateTime Type
~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~

If you first come across the requirement to save different timezones you may be still optimistic about how
to manage this mess,
however let me crush your expectations fast. There is not a single database out there (supported by Doctrine ORM)
that supports timezones correctly. Correctly here means that you can cover all the use-cases that
can come up with timezones. If you don't believe me you should read up on `Storing DateTime
in Databases <https://derickrethans.nl/storing-date-time-in-database.html>`_.

The problem is simple. Not a single database vendor saves the timezone, only the differences to UTC.
However with frequent daylight saving and political timezone changes you can have a UTC offset that moves
in different offset directions depending on the real location.

The solution for this dilemma seems simple: don't use timezones with DateTime(Immutable) and Doctrine 2. However there are some
workarounds that allow correct date-time handling with timezones depending on your use case:

1a. Don't convert DateTimes to UTC
1b. Always convert any DateTime instance to UTC
2. Set Timezones for displaying purposes
3. Save the Timezone in the Entity for persistence.

Wait: **What? Shall we convert to UTC or not?**

That depends on what kind of DateTimes you are handling! When you are handling current dates like log-entries or
datetimes that are within one or two days of the current date, you can - and even should - convert them to UTC.
But as soon as you are handling datetimes that are more than a few days in advance (or back) you should **not** convert them to UTC but instead keep them in their local timezone. Why? You might want to read up on `why not to convert a datetime to a timestamp<https://andreas.heigl.org/2016/12/22/why-not-to-convert-a-datetime-to-timestamp/>`_

Handling DateTimes with timezone-informations
_____________________________________________

Say we have an international calendaring application where users can add events that occur at different places
worldwide and therefore at different timezones. To determine the exact date and time an event will happen means to save
both the local time of the event and the timezone the event will happen in.

Using the default datetime-type will store the datetime in the local time but without the timezone information.
Therefore we need to store the timezone information as well and also need to provide a way to get the datetime
back from the database with the correct timezone-information.

To be able to transform these values back into their real timezone we have to save the timezone in a separate field of the entity requiring timezoned datetimes:

.. code-block:: php

    <?php
    namespace Calendaring;

    /**
     * @Entity
     */
    class Event
    {
        /** @Column(type="datetime") */
        private $eventDateTime;

        /** @Column(type="string") */
        private $timezone;

        /**
         * @var bool
         */
        private $localized = false;

        public function __construct(\DateTimeInterface $eventDateTime)
        {
            $this->localized = true;
            $this->eventDateTime = $eventDateTime;
            $this->timezone = $eventDateTime->getTimeZone()->getName();
        }

        public function getEventDateTime()
        {
            if (!$this->localized) {

                $this->eventDateTime = new DateTimeImmutable(
                    $this->eventDateTime->format('Y-m-d H:i:s'),
                    new \DateTimeZone($this->timezone)
                );
            }
            return $this->eventDateTime;
        }
    }

Using this way of handling timezones allows you also to use the database-specific ways of
doing DateTime-arithmetics with the appropriate timezones. Make sure though that the database
always has the latest version of the timezone-database when you use these features.

Handling log-like DateTimes that shall be converted to UTC
__________________________________________________________

Say we have an application for an international postal company and employees insert events regarding postal-package
around the world, in their current timezones. To determine the exact time an event occurred means to save both
the time of the booking and the timezone the event happened in.

As we are handling current dates here, it might be a good idea to convert the time to UTC. For that we can create a custom UTCDateTimeType:

.. code-block:: php

    <?php

    namespace DoctrineExtensions\DBAL\Types;

    use Doctrine\DBAL\Platforms\AbstractPlatform;
    use Doctrine\DBAL\Types\ConversionException;
    use Doctrine\DBAL\Types\DateTimeType;

    class UTCDateTimeType extends DateTimeType
    {
        static private $utc;

        public function convertToDatabaseValue($value, AbstractPlatform $platform)
        {
            if ($value instanceof \DateTime) {
                $value->setTimezone(self::getUtc());
            }

            return parent::convertToDatabaseValue($value, $platform);
        }

        public function convertToPHPValue($value, AbstractPlatform $platform)
        {
            if (null === $value || $value instanceof \DateTime) {
                return $value;
            }

            $converted = \DateTime::createFromFormat(
                $platform->getDateTimeFormatString(),
                $value,
                self::$utc ? self::$utc : self::$utc = new \DateTimeZone('UTC')
            );

            if (! $converted) {
                throw ConversionException::conversionFailedFormat(
                    $value,
                    $this->getName(),
                    $platform->getDateTimeFormatString()
                );
            }

            return $converted;
        }
    }

This database type makes sure that every DateTime instance is always saved in UTC, relative
to the current timezone that the passed DateTime instance has.

To actually use this new type instead of the default ``datetime`` type, you need to run following
code before bootstrapping the ORM:

.. code-block:: php

    <?php

    use Doctrine\DBAL\Types\Type;
    use DoctrineExtensions\DBAL\Types\UTCDateTimeType;

    Type::overrideType('datetime', UTCDateTimeType::class);
    Type::overrideType('datetimetz', UTCDateTimeType::class);


To be able to transform these values
back into their real timezone you have to save the timezone in a separate field of the entity
requiring timezoned datetimes:

.. code-block:: php

    <?php
    namespace Shipping;

    /**
     * @Entity
     */
    class Event
    {
        /** @Column(type="datetime") */
        private $created;

        /** @Column(type="string") */
        private $timezone;

        /**
         * @var bool
         */
        private $localized = false;

        public function __construct(\DateTimeImmutable $createDate)
        {
            $this->localized = true;
            $this->created = $createDate;
            $this->timezone = $createDate->getTimeZone()->getName();
        }

        public function getCreated()
        {
            if (!$this->localized) {
                $this->created->setTimeZone(new \DateTimeZone($this->timezone));

                $class = $this->created::class;
                $this->created = new $class(
                    $this->created->format('Y-m-d H:i:s'),
                    new \DateTimeZone($this->timezone)
                );
            }
            return $this->created;
        }
    }

These snippets makes use of the previously discussed "changeset by reference only" property of
objects. That means a new DateTime will only be used during updating if the reference
changes between retrieval and flush operation. This means we can easily go and modify
the instance by setting the previous local timezone.

Using this way of handling timezones allows you also to use the database-specific ways of
doing DateTime-arithmetics with the appropriate timezones. Make sure though that the database
always has the latest version of the timezone-database when you use these features.
