Installation and Configuration
==============================

Doctrine can be installed with `Composer <https://getcomposer.org>`_.

Define the following requirement in your ``composer.json`` file:

::

    {
        "require": {
            "doctrine/orm": "*"
        }
    }

Then call ``composer install`` from your command line. If you don't know
how Composer works, check out their `Getting Started <https://getcomposer.org/doc/00-intro.md>`_ to set up.

Class loading
-------------

Autoloading is taken care of by Composer. You just have to include the composer autoload file in your project:

.. code-block:: php

    <?php
    // bootstrap.php
    // Include Composer Autoload (relative to project root).
    require_once "vendor/autoload.php";

Obtaining an EntityManager
--------------------------

Once you have prepared the class loading, you acquire an
*EntityManager* instance. The EntityManager class is the primary
access point to ORM functionality provided by Doctrine.

.. code-block:: php

    <?php
    // bootstrap.php
    require_once "vendor/autoload.php";

    use Doctrine\ORM\Tools\Setup;
    use Doctrine\ORM\EntityManager;

    $paths = array("/path/to/entity-files");
    $isDevMode = false;

    // the connection configuration
    $dbParams = array(
        'driver'   => 'pdo_mysql',
        'user'     => 'root',
        'password' => '',
        'dbname'   => 'foo',
    );

    $config = Setup::createAnnotationMetadataConfiguration($paths, $isDevMode);
    $entityManager = EntityManager::create($dbParams, $config);

Or if you prefer XML:

.. code-block:: php

    <?php
    $paths = array("/path/to/xml-mappings");
    $config = Setup::createXMLMetadataConfiguration($paths, $isDevMode);
    $entityManager = EntityManager::create($dbParams, $config);

Or if you prefer YAML:

.. code-block:: php

    <?php
    $paths = array("/path/to/yml-mappings");
    $config = Setup::createYAMLMetadataConfiguration($paths, $isDevMode);
    $entityManager = EntityManager::create($dbParams, $config);

.. note::
    If you want to use yml mapping you should add yaml dependency to your `composer.json`:
    
    ::
    
        "symfony/yaml": "*"

Inside the ``Setup`` methods several assumptions are made:

-  If ``$isDevMode`` is true caching is done in memory with the ``ArrayCache``. Proxy objects are recreated on every request.
-  If ``$isDevMode`` is false, check for Caches in the order APC, Xcache, Memcache (127.0.0.1:11211), Redis (127.0.0.1:6379) unless `$cache` is passed as fourth argument.
-  If ``$isDevMode`` is false, set then proxy classes have to be explicitly created through the command line.
-  If third argument `$proxyDir` is not set, use the systems temporary directory.

If you want to configure Doctrine in more detail, take a look at the :doc:`Advanced Configuration <reference/advanced-configuration>` section.

.. note::

    You can learn more about the database connection configuration in the
    `Doctrine DBAL connection configuration reference <https://docs.doctrine-project.org/projects/doctrine-dbal/en/latest/reference/configuration.html>`_.

Setting up the Commandline Tool
-------------------------------

Doctrine ships with a number of command line tools that are very helpful
during development. You can call this command from the Composer binary
directory:

.. code-block:: sh

    $ php vendor/bin/doctrine

You need to register your applications EntityManager to the console tool
to make use of the tasks by creating a ``cli-config.php`` file with the
following content:

.. code-block:: php

    <?php
    use Doctrine\ORM\Tools\Console\ConsoleRunner;

    // replace with file to your own project bootstrap
    require_once 'bootstrap.php';

    // replace with mechanism to retrieve EntityManager in your app
    $entityManager = GetEntityManager();

    return ConsoleRunner::createHelperSet($entityManager);
