Doctrine Console
----------------

The Doctrine Console is a Command Line Interface tool for simplifying common
administration tasks during the development of a project that uses Doctrine 2.

Take a look at the :doc:`Installation and Configuration <configuration>`
chapter for more information how to setup the console command.

Display Help Information
~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~

Type ``php vendor/bin/doctrine`` on the command line and you should see an
overview of the available commands or use the --help flag to get
information on the available commands. If you want to know more
about the use of generate entities for example, you can call:

.. code-block:: php

    $> php vendor/bin/doctrine orm:generate-entities --help


Configuration
~~~~~~~~~~~~~

Whenever the ``doctrine`` command line tool is invoked, it can
access all Commands that were registered by developer. There is no
auto-detection mechanism at work. The Doctrine binary
already registers all the commands that currently ship with
Doctrine DBAL and ORM. If you want to use additional commands you
have to register them yourself.

All the commands of the Doctrine Console require access to the ``EntityManager``
or ``DBAL`` Connection. You have to inject them into the console application
using so called Helper-Sets. This requires either the ``db``
or the ``em`` helpers to be defined in order to work correctly.

Whenever you invoke the Doctrine binary the current folder is searched for a
``cli-config.php`` file. This file contains the project specific configuration:

.. code-block:: php

    <?php
    $helperSet = new \Symfony\Component\Console\Helper\HelperSet(array(
        'db' => new \Doctrine\DBAL\Tools\Console\Helper\ConnectionHelper($conn)
    ));
    $cli->setHelperSet($helperSet);

When dealing with the ORM package, the EntityManagerHelper is
required:

.. code-block:: php

    <?php
    $helperSet = new \Symfony\Component\Console\Helper\HelperSet(array(
        'em' => new \Doctrine\ORM\Tools\Console\Helper\EntityManagerHelper($em)
    ));
    $cli->setHelperSet($helperSet);

The HelperSet instance has to be generated in a separate file (i.e.
``cli-config.php``) that contains typical Doctrine bootstrap code
and predefines the needed HelperSet attributes mentioned above. A
sample ``cli-config.php`` file looks as follows:

.. code-block:: php

    <?php
    // cli-config.php
    require_once 'my_bootstrap.php';

    // Any way to access the EntityManager from  your application
    $em = GetMyEntityManager();
    
    $helperSet = new \Symfony\Component\Console\Helper\HelperSet(array(
        'db' => new \Doctrine\DBAL\Tools\Console\Helper\ConnectionHelper($em->getConnection()),
        'em' => new \Doctrine\ORM\Tools\Console\Helper\EntityManagerHelper($em)
    ));

It is important to define a correct HelperSet that Doctrine binary
script will ultimately use. The Doctrine Binary will automatically
find the first instance of HelperSet in the global variable
namespace and use this.

.. note:: 

    You have to adjust this snippet for your specific application or framework
    and use their facilities to access the Doctrine EntityManager and
    Connection Resources.

.. note::

    Console also supports auto completion, for example, instead of
    ``orm:clear-cache:query`` you can use just ``o:c:q``.

Database Schema Generation
--------------------------

.. note::

    SchemaTool can do harm to your database. It will drop or alter
    tables, indexes, sequences and such. Please use this tool with
    caution in development and not on a production server. It is meant
    for helping you develop your Database Schema, but NOT with
    migrating schema from A to B in production. A safe approach would
    be generating the SQL on development server and saving it into SQL
    Migration files that are executed manually on the production
    server.

    SchemaTool assumes your Doctrine Project uses the given database on
    its own. Update and Drop commands will mess with other tables if
    they are not related to the current project that is using Doctrine.
    Please be careful!


To generate your database schema from your Doctrine mapping files
you can use the ``SchemaTool`` class or the ``schema-tool`` Console
Command.

When using the SchemaTool class directly, create your schema using
the ``createSchema()`` method. First create an instance of the
``SchemaTool`` and pass it an instance of the ``EntityManager``
that you want to use to create the schema. This method receives an
array of ``ClassMetadataInfo`` instances.

.. code-block:: php

    <?php
    $tool = new \Doctrine\ORM\Tools\SchemaTool($em);
    $classes = array(
      $em->getClassMetadata('Entities\User'),
      $em->getClassMetadata('Entities\Profile')
    );
    $tool->createSchema($classes);

To drop the schema you can use the ``dropSchema()`` method.

.. code-block:: php

    <?php
    $tool->dropSchema($classes);

This drops all the tables that are currently used by your metadata
model. When you are changing your metadata a lot during development
you might want to drop the complete database instead of only the
tables of the current model to clean up with orphaned tables.

.. code-block:: php

    <?php
    $tool->dropSchema($classes, \Doctrine\ORM\Tools\SchemaTool::DROP_DATABASE);

You can also use database introspection to update your schema
easily with the ``updateSchema()`` method. It will compare your
existing database schema to the passed array of
``ClassMetadataInfo`` instances.

.. code-block:: php

    <?php
    $tool->updateSchema($classes);

If you want to use this functionality from the command line you can
use the ``schema-tool`` command.

To create the schema use the ``create`` command:

.. code-block:: php

    $ php doctrine orm:schema-tool:create

To drop the schema use the ``drop`` command:

.. code-block:: php

    $ php doctrine orm:schema-tool:drop

If you want to drop and then recreate the schema then use both
options:

.. code-block:: php

    $ php doctrine orm:schema-tool:drop
    $ php doctrine orm:schema-tool:create

As you would think, if you want to update your schema use the
``update`` command:

.. code-block:: php

    $ php doctrine orm:schema-tool:update

All of the above commands also accept a ``--dump-sql`` option that
will output the SQL for the ran operation.

.. code-block:: php

    $ php doctrine orm:schema-tool:create --dump-sql

Before using the orm:schema-tool commands, remember to configure
your cli-config.php properly.

Entity Generation
-----------------

Generate entity classes and method stubs from your mapping information.

.. code-block:: php

    $ php doctrine orm:generate-entities
    $ php doctrine orm:generate-entities --update-entities
    $ php doctrine orm:generate-entities --regenerate-entities

This command is not suited for constant usage. It is a little helper and does
not support all the mapping edge cases very well. You still have to put work
in your entities after using this command.

It is possible to use the EntityGenerator on code that you have already written. It will
not be lost. The EntityGenerator will only append new code to your
file and will not delete the old code. However this approach may still be prone
to error and we suggest you use code repositories such as GIT or SVN to make
backups of your code.

It makes sense to generate the entity code if you are using entities as Data
Access Objects only and don't put much additional logic on them. If you are
however putting much more logic on the entities you should refrain from using
the entity-generator and code your entities manually.

.. note::

    Even if you specified Inheritance options in your
    XML or YAML Mapping files the generator cannot generate the base and
    child classes for you correctly, because it doesn't know which
    class is supposed to extend which. You have to adjust the entity
    code manually for inheritance to work!


Convert Mapping Information
---------------------------

Convert mapping information between supported formats.

This is an **execute one-time** command. It should not be necessary for
you to call this method multiple times, especially when using the ``--from-database``
flag.

Converting an existing database schema into mapping files only solves about 70-80%
of the necessary mapping information. Additionally the detection from an existing
database cannot detect inverse associations, inheritance types,
entities with foreign keys as primary keys and many of the
semantical operations on associations such as cascade.

.. note::

    There is no need to convert YAML or XML mapping files to annotations
    every time you make changes. All mapping drivers are first class citizens
    in Doctrine 2 and can be used as runtime mapping for the ORM. See the
    docs on XML and YAML Mapping for an example how to register this metadata
    drivers as primary mapping source.

To convert some mapping information between the various supported
formats you can use the ``ClassMetadataExporter`` to get exporter
instances for the different formats:

.. code-block:: php

    <?php
    $cme = new \Doctrine\ORM\Tools\Export\ClassMetadataExporter();

Once you have a instance you can use it to get an exporter. For
example, the yml exporter:

.. code-block:: php

    <?php
    $exporter = $cme->getExporter('yml', '/path/to/export/yml');

Now you can export some ``ClassMetadata`` instances:

.. code-block:: php

    <?php
    $classes = array(
      $em->getClassMetadata('Entities\User'),
      $em->getClassMetadata('Entities\Profile')
    );
    $exporter->setMetadata($classes);
    $exporter->export();

This functionality is also available from the command line to
convert your loaded mapping information to another format. The
``orm:convert-mapping`` command accepts two arguments, the type to
convert to and the path to generate it:

.. code-block:: php

    $ php doctrine orm:convert-mapping xml /path/to/mapping-path-converted-to-xml

Reverse Engineering
-------------------

You can use the ``DatabaseDriver`` to reverse engineer a database
to an array of ``ClassMetadataInfo`` instances and generate YAML,
XML, etc. from them.

.. note::

    Reverse Engineering is a **one-time** process that can get you started with a project.
    Converting an existing database schema into mapping files only detects about 70-80%
    of the necessary mapping information. Additionally the detection from an existing
    database cannot detect inverse associations, inheritance types,
    entities with foreign keys as primary keys and many of the
    semantical operations on associations such as cascade.

First you need to retrieve the metadata instances with the
``DatabaseDriver``:

.. code-block:: php

    <?php
    $em->getConfiguration()->setMetadataDriverImpl(
        new \Doctrine\ORM\Mapping\Driver\DatabaseDriver(
            $em->getConnection()->getSchemaManager()
        )
    );
    
    $cmf = new \Doctrine\ORM\Tools\DisconnectedClassMetadataFactory();
    $cmf->setEntityManager($em);
    $metadata = $cmf->getAllMetadata();

Now you can get an exporter instance and export the loaded metadata
to yml:

.. code-block:: php

    <?php
    $cme = new \Doctrine\ORM\Tools\Export\ClassMetadataExporter();
    $exporter = $cme->getExporter('yml', '/path/to/export/yml');
    $exporter->setMetadata($metadata);
    $exporter->export();

You can also reverse engineer a database using the
``orm:convert-mapping`` command:

.. code-block:: php

    $ php doctrine orm:convert-mapping --from-database yml /path/to/mapping-path-converted-to-yml

.. note::

    Reverse Engineering is not always working perfectly
    depending on special cases. It will only detect Many-To-One
    relations (even if they are One-To-One) and will try to create
    entities from Many-To-Many tables. It also has problems with naming
    of foreign keys that have multiple column names. Any Reverse
    Engineered Database-Schema needs considerable manual work to become
    a useful domain model.


Runtime vs Development Mapping Validation
-----------------------------------------

For performance reasons Doctrine 2 has to skip some of the
necessary validation of metadata mappings. You have to execute
this validation in your development workflow to verify the
associations are correctly defined.

You can either use the Doctrine Command Line Tool:

.. code-block:: php

    doctrine orm:validate-schema

Or you can trigger the validation manually:

.. code-block:: php

    <?php
    use Doctrine\ORM\Tools\SchemaValidator;

    $validator = new SchemaValidator($entityManager);
    $errors = $validator->validateMapping();

    if (count($errors) > 0) {
        // Lots of errors!
        echo implode("\n\n", $errors);
    }

If the mapping is invalid the errors array contains a positive
number of elements with error messages.

.. warning::

    One mapping option that is not validated is the use of the referenced column name.
    It has to point to the equivalent primary key otherwise Doctrine will not work.

.. note::

    One common error is to use a backlash in front of the
    fully-qualified class-name. Whenever a FQCN is represented inside a
    string (such as in your mapping definitions) you have to drop the
    prefix backslash. PHP does this with ``get_class()`` or Reflection
    methods for backwards compatibility reasons.


Adding own commands
-------------------

You can also add your own commands on-top of the Doctrine supported
tools if you are using a manually built console script.

To include a new command on Doctrine Console, you need to do modify the
``doctrine.php`` file a little:

.. code-block:: php

    <?php
    // doctrine.php
    use Symfony\Component\Console\Application;

    // as before ...

    // replace the ConsoleRunner::run() statement with:
    $cli = new Application('Doctrine Command Line Interface', \Doctrine\ORM\Version::VERSION);
    $cli->setCatchExceptions(true);
    $cli->setHelperSet($helperSet);

    // Register All Doctrine Commands
    ConsoleRunner::addCommands($cli);

    // Register your own command
    $cli->addCommand(new \MyProject\Tools\Console\Commands\MyCustomCommand);

    // Runs console application
    $cli->run();

Additionally, include multiple commands (and overriding previously
defined ones) is possible through the command:

.. code-block:: php

    <?php

    $cli->addCommands(array(
        new \MyProject\Tools\Console\Commands\MyCustomCommand(),
        new \MyProject\Tools\Console\Commands\SomethingCommand(),
        new \MyProject\Tools\Console\Commands\AnotherCommand(),
        new \MyProject\Tools\Console\Commands\OneMoreCommand(),
    ));


Re-use console application
--------------------------

You are also able to retrieve and re-use the default console application.
Just call ``ConsoleRunner::createApplication(...)`` with an appropriate
HelperSet, like it is described in the configuration section.

.. code-block:: php

    <?php

    // Retrieve default console application
    $cli = ConsoleRunner::createApplication($helperSet);

    // Runs console application
    $cli->run();
